- **Office Hours:** Thursday, 2–4 PM. Try to make it to my listed office hours _first_. If you have a conflict with that time, direct message me on Discord with a few alternative times that work for you, preferably in the afternoon. Appointments are generally for discussing course progress; for technical questions / assignment questions please use the public Discord server so that everyone can benefit from the discussion. Finally, I am always excited to take appointments with students interested in doing research / projects with me (independent study, thesis advising/reading, etc.); log on and say hi!

## Course Description
IMGD 5100 will discuss interaction through the lens of *Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction* (often shortened to TEI), considering issues of embodiment in virtual environments, alternative physical interfaces, and human-computer interaction in the digital arts, games, and crafts. Assignments in the class will reach across a variety of different mediums to explore user interaction: text-only, audio-only, and integrated multimodal approaches. Additonal goals include studying fundamental human-computer interaction principles, practicing critique, and exposure to a variety of technologies for interaction and user experience design.

The course will supplemented with guest lectures from both within and outside the WPI community, including experts in haptics, novel human-computer interaction in dance, tangible programming languages, immersive audio, and experience design for embodied installations. 

## Keep up with course announcements and participate on the Discord
Make sure you join the Discord server (see link at top of syllabus). Important announcements will be made via Discord, so make sure you're logging on regularly. This is also the best place to ask questions... and hopefully answer when you have some expertise to share. Please stay on top of course communications.

## Materials
This course will provide time for students to explore physical computing / microcontroller programming, using a [kit you must purchase](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3795). You should also purchase [the case](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3915). No textbook is required for the class.
 
## Grades
50% [Weekly readings / design sprints](https://github.com/charlieroberts/IMGD-5100-2022.github.io/blob/main/README.md#course-outline-subject-to-change)  
50% Project(s)

Late work is accepted for design/development assignments, however, turning in such assignments late will often mean you miss out on chances for in-class critique. *Please do your best to complete the weekly readings*, as class discussion will be both confusing and potentially boring without doing so.

## Attendance
Don't miss class if at all possible! Class will provide critique sessions, a variety of guest lectures, and other opportunities that can't easily be replicated.

## Final Project
The final project is open-ended; you are encouraged to follow your personal interests to create a project that explores tangible and/or embodied interaction. This could include:

- A game that you make with an accompanying alternative control device
- An embodied interface for making visual art, crafts, or music
- An immersive experience that explores haptics
- A VR / AR experience
- A more focused HCI experiment where you design / test an interface for research purposes

You are required to do some type of user evaluation of your work. Give this some thought and be preapred to justify your chosen evaluation. I highly encourage group projects, and also highly encourage you to combine this project with projects from other courses as appropriate.

Here is a timeline of deliverables for the project:

1. A short paper (less than a page) describing what your project will be, what challenges / difficulties you expect to encounter when building it, and how you will evaluate it. Due 11/15.

2. Prototype I. You will casually show/discuss your prototype with 1–2 other members of the class + the instructor on this day. Be prepared to either show pre-recorded video or do live demonstrations of your work. Due 12/2

3. Check-in. Send a brief (< one page) summary of your progress to date to the instructor. You should now be at a point where you're ready to begin evaluating your work more seriously, and there will be class time allocated for this. Due 12/9

4. Final project presentations. Please also create a small website that contains documentation of your project, including a brief description of the concept, a video of it in action, and a description of your evaluation and its results. Due 12/16 (last day of class)

## Course Outline (subject to change)
For all readings, please prepare a paragraph or two (>200 words) describing points of interest you found in the article, questions you might have, and topics for discussion in class. Please submit this by 10AM the morning they are due, this will hopefully give me time to scan them before class.

### Week 1: what is 'tangible' , what is 'embodied' and what is TEI? 
Readings (due Aug. 26th by class time):
- [Human–computer interaction, foundations and new paradigms](https://www.alandix.com/academic/papers/JVLC-2016-HCI-FNP/JVLC-special-2016-draft.pdf) by Alan Dix  
- [Direct Manipulation:
A Step Beyond Programming Languages](https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/ben/papers/Shneiderman1983Direct.pdf) by Ben Shneiderman  
- [Getting a Grip on Tangible Interaction: A Framework on Physical Space and Social Interaction](http://www.ehornecker.de/Papers/FrameworkCHI.pdf) by Eva Hornecker and Jacob Buur  
- [Tangible Bits: Beyond Pixels](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1347390.1347392) by Hiroshi Ishii

### Week 2: Embodied text(?) and the keyboard / mouse as input devices
#### Design Sprint (choose one, due Aug 29th.)
*Live Coding*

Experiment with one or more of the environments below:
- [Hydra (2D visuals)](https://hydra.ojack.xyz)
- [Livecodelab (3D visuals + a bit of music](https://livecodelab.net/)
- [Screamer (ray-marched visuals)](https://charlieroberts.github.io/screamer/playground/)
- [Gibber (music + 3D visuals)](https://gibber.cc/alpha/playground)
- [Barbara (2D visuals + programming language creation)](https://www.barbara.graphics/)

Create a short (2–3 minute) performance using one of these systems (consider syncing to music if you’re doing a graphics performance). You will be asked to conduct peer critiques of this assignment in groups next week. As you use these systems, consider how the “embodiedness” of the environment (or lack thereof) is contributing to your work. Do you find yourself wanting tangible controls? Do the keys become tangible? The mouse?

Write a short response (minimum 250 words) addressing these questions and other aspects of the environment you found interesting or problematic. 

Include a link to a video of your performance at the top of your design sprint, and please share the recording in the class Discord channel. 

*Interactive Fiction*

For this assignment, you will create a work of “interactive fiction”. This can be a game, a story, or you can take artistic license with the assignment to do something more creative with text and interaction. The only limitation is that text, and text alone, is the sole medium you may use to present your project.

There are a few different tools for creating interactive fiction. The most popular of these is [Twine](http://twinery.org/) , which primarily relies on hypertext links for interaction. However, you can also have variables, conditionals, and other programmatic constructs to make interaction more complex than you might expect from a hyperlink based system.

There are also tools where natural language parsing (asking users to enter text at a prompt) is used instead of pointing and clicking. Two of the most popular of these are [TADS](http://www.tads.org/) and [Inform](http://inform7.com/) . 

[Here’s a comprehensive comparison of a number of different IF systems by Emily Short](https://emshort.blog/how-to-play/writing-if/)

The experience you create should be designed to be completed in about 15 minutes; we will be critiquing them in class next week. In addition to creating the assignment you will also need to provide a written summary of what you did (minimum 250 words). This summary should briefly describe what you created, what your inspiration was, and what tool you chose to author your work. Please also consider whether or not you think the work creates sense of immersion and whether or not you feel the work is embodied in any way.

Submit your writing via Discord and be sure to include a link to your project! The Emily Short article linked above has useful suggestions for how to distribute your work.
